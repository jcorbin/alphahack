## TODO

- meta: alfagok lines not getting collected
  ```
  pick 4754d78e # alfagok.diginaut.net day #345
  ```

- [regexle](https://regexle.com): on program

- dontword:
  - upstream site seems to be glitchy wrt generating result copy on mobile
  - workaround by synthesizing?
  - workaround by storing complete-but-unverified anyhow?

- hurdle: report wasn't right out of #1373 -- was missing first few rounds

- square: finish questioning work

- reuse input injection mechanism from store
  - wherever the current input injection usage is
  - and also to allow more seamless meta log continue ...

- meta:
  - `day` command needs to be able to progress even without all solvers done
  - `day` pruning should be more agro
  - rework command model
    * current `log <solver> ...` and `run <solver>` should instead
    * unify into `<solver> log|run ...`
    * with the same stateful sub-prompting so that we can just say `<solver>`
      and then `log ...` and then `run` obviating the `log continue` command
      separate from just `run`
  - review should progress main branch too
  - better logic circa end of day early play, e.g. doing a CET timezone puzzle
    close late in the "prior" day local (EST) time; similarly, early play of
    next-day spaceword should work gracefully
  - support other intervals like weekly/monthly for spaceword

- StoredLog:
  - log compression can sometimes get corrupted; spaceword in particular tends
    to provoke this bug
  - log event generation and pattern matching are currently too disjointed
    - currently the event matching is all collected under a `load` method override:
      ```python
      class Whatever(StoredLog):
        @override
        def load(self, ui: PromptUI, lines: Iterable[str]):
          for t, rest in super().load(ui, lines):
            orig_rest = rest
            with ui.exc_print(lambda: f'while loading {orig_rest!r}'):

              m = re.match(r'''(?x)
                bob \s+ ( .+ )
                $''', rest)
              if m:
                  wat = m[1]
                  self.apply_bla(wat)
                  continue

              yield t, rest

      ```
      * not all subclasses provide the exception printing facility...
      * many similar `if-match-continue` leg under the loop-with
      * ideally state re-application is a cleanly nominated method like `self.applay_bla`
    - so then event generation usually looks like:
      ```python
      class Whatever(StoredLog):
        def do_bla(self, ui: PromptUI):
          wat = 'lob law'
          ui.log(f'bob {wat}')
          self.apply_bla(wat)

        def apply_bla(self, wat: str):
          self.wat.append(wat)

        def __init__(self):
          self.wat: list[str] = []
      ```
      * this again is in an ideal, in practice logging is frequently intermixed
        with state mutation; i.e. the `apply_` and `do_` methods are fused
      * note also there is the matter of state (re-)initialization to keep in
        mind as well; every part must have a declaration under `__init__`
    - so a first seam to start pulling at here would be to unify event
      generation and matching with some kinda decorator like:
      ```python
      class Whatever(StoredLog):
        @StateEvent(
          lambda wat: f'bob {wat}',
          r'''(?x)
            bob \s+ ( .+ )
            $''',
        )
        def apply_bla(self, wat: str):
          self.wat.append(wat)
      ```
  - would be nice if logs could contain multiple concurrent sessions
    - each session would need an identifier
    - each session would then name its parent(s)
    - at least for bakcwards compat, we need to support reading sid-less logs
      - so each log entry's sid needs to default to last-seen
      - and each session needs to get a default sid generated
      - for default parentage, we'll just go with last-wins semantics
    - but going forward the log format becomes `S<id> T<t> ...`
      - or is that `T[sid.]t ...` ; i.e. session id is just an extra dimension
        of time... oh I like that...
    - so replay needs to support a frontier of concurrent sessions
    - and load should at least collect extant sibling IDs
    - so a merge would look like:
      1. prior log contains concurrent sessions A and B
      2. start new session C parented to A
      3. its load logic sees extant B
         * loads B's state
         * reconciles, logging catch-up state mutations
         * ending in reconciliation done log entry
      4. load logic no longer recognizes B as extant
         * ... until/unless novel log entries are seen from it

- expired prompt could be better:
  ```
  🔺 -> <ui.Prompt object at 0x754fdf9f6190>
  🔺 <ui.Prompt object at 0x754fdf9f6190>[f]inalize, [a]rchive, [r]emove, or [c]ontinue? rem
  🔺 'rem' -> StoredLog.expired_do_remove
  ```
  - `rm` alias
  - dynamically generated suggestion prompt, or at least one that's correct ( as "r" is ambiguously actually )

- ui: [disabled] thrash detection works too well
  - triggers on semantic's extract-next-token tight loop
  - best way to reliably fix it is to capture per-round output, and only count
    thrash if output is looping

- long lines like these are hard to read; a line-breaking pretty formatter
  would be nice:
  ```
  🔺 -> functools.partial(<function Search.do_round.<locals>.wrap at 0x7f8ef4e0f100>, st=<wordlish.Question object at 0x7f8ef4e52e90>)
  🔺 functools.partial(<function Search.do_round.<locals>.wrap at 0x7f8ef4e0f100>, st=<wordlish.Question object at 0x7f8ef4e52e90>)#1 ____S ~E -ANT  📋 "elder" ? _L__S ~ ESD
  ```

- semantic: final stats seems lightly off ; where's the party?

- space higher level automation:
  ```
  {set capn = 750}

  /sea -cap {capn}
  {expect done}
  show done
  show {highest score index ; why isn't this just 1}
  ret
  {:loop}
  /sea -cap {2*capn}
  {expect done ; if not, retry up to 2 times? ; else just continue with earlier result}
  show done
  show {highest score index ; why isn't this just 1}
  ret
  {:continue}

  {present to user for entry}
  {expect score ; are we good enough yet? -- e.g. stop daily at 2173}
  {set capn *= 2}

  /sea -clear -cap {capn}
  {expect done ; if not, retry up to 4 times? does cap grow with retry #?}
  show done
  show {highest score index ; why isn't this just 1}
  ret
  {:loop}
  /sea -cap {capn}
  {expect done ; if not, retry up to 2 times? ; else just continue with earlier result}
  show done

  ret
  {:continue}

  {present to user for entry}
  {expect score ; are we good enough yet? -- e.g. stop daily at 2173}
  # ...

  # TODO how about a deadline? in terms of state rounds and/or time?
