1selerate the following changes to make this instruction more challenging by increasing its complexity: 
- Increase word count from five words to ten different words or phrases that are similar in meaning, ensuring 
each has a distinct nuance and is not commonly interchanged with one another.
- At least half of the suggested terms should be lesser known synonyms for "effectuation" and "finalization", 
increasing difficulty in finding appropriate replacements as these words may rarely appear in everyday languag
e, requiring more specialized vocabulary knowledge.
- All proposed alternatives must maintain a formal tone suitable to academic or professional contexts where pr
ecise word choice is critical. 
- The terms suggested should cover different stages of the process leading up to finalization and effectuation
 without any overlap among their meanings within those specific phases.
