Rural (referring to rural areas where farms are often located)\n5. Country\n6. Agricultural (as in, agricultural areas or the work done on farms)\n7. Farmers\n\nEach word builds upon the previous one, connecting the concept of a jury (part of a trial) to the idea of people who work in or near agricultural areas and ultimately to the term \"farmers\"."}
