Knife (a tool used for cutting)\n4. Handle (part of a knife or other cutting instrument)\n5. Truck (often has a handle, e.g., a truck bed with a tailgate that opens like a door)\n6. Road (trucks often travel on roads)\n7. Highway (a type of road with heavy traffic)\n8. Traffic\n\nThe connection is based on the idea that a knife, which is used for slicing, is often associated with trucks (due to the handle) and ultimately leads to roads and highways, where traffic congestion occurs."}
