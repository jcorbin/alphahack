The vision serves as a guide for navigating towards that goal. Finally, a navigator is someone who uses a compass (a tool used for navigation) to guide others or themselves in achieving their goals.\n\nAlternatively, here's another sequence:\n\n1. Target\n2.

The vision is like the direction on the steering wheel of a vehicle, while a navigational aid is used to guide others in achieving their objectives.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!"}

Viewpoint\n5. Landscape\n6. Cartography\n7. Map\n8. Compass\n\nThis sequence starts with the concept of a horizon, which represents the boundary beyond which our vision can see. An outlook or perspective follows, which shapes our view on things. A viewpoint is a specific location from which we observe something, like a landscape. Cartography is the study of maps, and maps are used to navigate, thus leading to the compass.\n\nAlternatively, here's another sequence:\n\n1. Imagination\n2. Dream\n3. Aspiration\n4. Ambition\n5. Goal\n6. Direction\n7. Course\n8. Compass\n\nThis sequence starts with the power of imagination, which can lead to dreaming and aspirations. An ambition follows, setting a goal in mind. The goal provides direction, guiding us on a course. Finally, a compass is used to navigate this course.\n\nLet me know if you'd like another option!"}

Here's a series of 6 words that connects $A to $B:

1. goal
2. vision
3. perspective
4. viewpoint
5. landscape
6. cartography
7. compass
8. guide

You'll need to do better than this, by finding a shorter and more direct connection between $A and $B.
